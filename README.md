# Kiedrowski-HRM-Project
Hudson River Museum Project

This website and python code all came about from an internship at the Hudson River Museum in the Fall of 2017.

I've attached two python scrips: 1) for pulling media from the 50 Classifications and organizing it into categories and 2) for pulling dates out of the title category and placing it into it's own column

Thanks to Matt Miller for the skills and patience for helping to get this off the ground.
